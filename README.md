# Muscala
Just another Scala-based music theory library

## What is this project?
This project aims to provide a music theory library for developers to
use in their own projects. This project was heavily inspired by 
existing music theory libraries, such as Python's 
[mingus](https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus) library, 
as well as 
Go's [go-music-theory](https://github.com/go-music-theory/music-theory) 
library. This project aims to deliver a similar experience to those libraries
by building off of the successes and mistakes made in those music theory
libraries to deliver an idiomatic Scala experience.

## Contributions
I welcome any contributions, whether they're pull requests, issues, or
just friendly advice on how I could make this project better! I'm still a
rookie with Scala, so any advice on how I can make this more idiomatic or
perhaps ways to improve the code base would be greatly appreciated!
