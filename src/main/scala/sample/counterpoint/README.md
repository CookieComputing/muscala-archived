# Two Voice Composition (Species Counterpoint)
This sample project contains an example in how to use the 
[muscala](https://github.com/CookieComputing/muscala) repository. The 
sample project contains code for checking the validity of a sample piece
written for counterpoint. Examples include a cantus firmus checker, and
potentially more species counterpoint checkers in the future.
